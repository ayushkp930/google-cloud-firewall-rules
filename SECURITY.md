# Security Policy

## Purpose of This Project

This repository documents a Google Cloud lab where:

- VPC firewall rules were created and modified
- HTTP and SSH access to a VM was tested
- Logs Explorer was used to review allowed and denied traffic

The goal is to learn **secure firewall configuration**, not to bypass security.

## Reporting an Issue

If you notice:
- An unsafe firewall example
- A missing warning
- Or something that could easily be misused

Please:

1. Avoid sharing sensitive details publicly.
2. Open a GitHub issue with a high-level description, **or**
3. Contact the author privately via GitHub.

## Legal & Ethical Requirements

- Only configure or test firewall rules on projects/environments where you have
  explicit authorization.
- Respect your organization’s policies and Google Cloud terms of service.
- Do not use this project to perform denial-of-service, port scanning, or other
  unauthorized attacks.
